# Getting and cleaning data - run_Analysis.R Code Book

Each row of the datasets represents an experiment, consisting on a person performing one of six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the research team captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. The complete dataset was then randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed and, from each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
